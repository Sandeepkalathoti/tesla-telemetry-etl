Tesla Vehicle Telemetry ETL Pipeline
Major data engineering project for processing Tesla-style connected vehicle telemetry from Amazon S3, orchestrating ETL with Apache Airflow, and loading curated near-real-time monitoring tables into Snowflake.

Project Scope
This project is designed as a portfolio-grade, end-to-end ETL system. It covers ingestion, schema validation, data quality checks, transformations, warehouse loading, orchestration, observability, and deployment-ready configuration.

Features
S3 raw telemetry ingestion with partition-aware paths.
Incremental object processing using a Snowflake PROCESSED_S3_OBJECTS control table.
Schema enforcement for vehicle telemetry events.
Data quality rules for battery, speed, location, odometer, timestamp, duplicate events, and VIN fields.
Transformations for trip metrics, battery health, alerts, and monitoring aggregates.
Snowflake stage, staging tables, COPY INTO, and MERGE based curated loading.
Airflow DAG with extract, validate, transform, load, and quality-gate tasks.
Local sample data and tests for fast development.
Environment-based configuration for AWS, Snowflake, and Airflow.
GitHub Actions workflow for automated tests.

Quick Start
Create and activate a virtual environment.
Install dependencies:
pip install -e ".[dev]"
Run tests:
pytest
Run the local ETL sample:
python -m telemetry_etl.transform data/sample/tesla_telemetry_sample.jsonl build/curated
On Windows PowerShell:

.\scripts\run_local_etl.ps1
Start Airflow locally:
docker compose up airflow-init
docker compose up
Airflow UI will be available at http://localhost:8080 with username airflow and password airflow.

Sample Output
Running the local ETL sample creates curated Parquet files in build/curated:

telemetry_enriched.parquet
vehicle_hourly_metrics.parquet
Snowflake Setup
Run the SQL files in order:

snowflake/001_create_database_schema.sql
snowflake/002_create_tables.sql
snowflake/003_curated_models.sql
The Airflow DAG uploads curated Parquet files to TELEMETRY_INTERNAL_STAGE, copies them into staging tables, merges them into curated tables, and records processed S3 keys after a successful load.

Environment Variables
Copy .env.example to .env and fill in values for AWS, Snowflake, and Airflow.
